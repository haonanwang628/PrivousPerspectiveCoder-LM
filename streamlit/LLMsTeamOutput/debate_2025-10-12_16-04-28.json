    "target_text": "Okay, so firstly, the sprint planning meeting right. So, during the sprint planning meeting, each and every user story. So, they user stories are already there in the black block. In our set up, what I always advise the team, is that they should go through the user stories applied to the sprint planning meeting so that they know for sure what are the questions they have for the product owner. So that helps. So now, a set of the team has gone through the user stories. They know what is there in the background. They join the meeting. So how it helps is, whatever question that he has, the product owner answers it during the sprint planning meeting itself. So, the sprint planning meeting is the start of the sprint. So, if we have any doubt or query, that is answered at the very beginning rather than bringing up questions towards the end. That gives the team of the entire duration of the sprint, to work on something, rather than if it was the question was asked later on. This collaboration with the PO helps better understanding of the user stories. Then the team knows what to develop and test. What I have experiences, it a good collaboration with a knowledgeable PO reduces defects. We receive feedback on ongoing bases and we rectify quickly.",
